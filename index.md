---# 🏆 Trainer Coins

**Trainer Coins** is a hold-focused crypto project inspired by classic game progression systems.

Instead of constant actions, staking, or spending mechanics, Trainer Coins emphasizes **ranking, status, and long-term commitment**.  
Your wallet balance represents your progression — just like leveling up a trainer.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Trainer Coins is designed to be **stacked and held**, with community visibility provided through:

- A **public ranking website**
- A **team generator** that reflects holder rank and status
- Long-term progression instead of short-term utility actions

Ownership is the achievement.

## ⚙️ Core Utility

Trainer Coins utility is intentionally minimal and focused:

- **Wallet-based ranking system**
- **Rank tiers determined by holdings**
- **Team generator tied directly to rank**
- **Community showcase tools**

No forced staking.  
No unnecessary mechanics.  
Status is earned by commitment.

## 🧩 How Ranking Works (Overview)

- Rankings are based on **wallet holdings**
- Higher balances unlock **higher trainer ranks**
- Ranks are publicly visible
